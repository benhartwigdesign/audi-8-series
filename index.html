    <h1>The Audi A8</h1> 

    <p>The Audi A8 is a four-door, full-size, luxury sedan manufactured and marketed 
      by the German automaker <em>Audi</em> since 1994. Succeeding the Audi V8, and now in 
      its third generation, the A8 has been offered with both front- or permanent 
      all-wheel driveâ€”and in short- and long-wheelbase variants. The first two 
      generations employed the Volkswagen Group D platform, with the current 
      generation deriving from the MLB platform. After the original model's 1994 
      release, Audi released the second generation in late 2002, and the third and 
      current iteration in late 2009.<br>
      
      Notable for being the first mass-market car with an aluminium chassis, all A8 
      models have used this construction method co-developed with Alcoa and marketed 
      as the Audi Space Frame.<br>

      A mechanically-upgraded, high-performance version of the A8 debuted in 1996 as 
      the Audi S8. Produced exclusively at Audi's Neckarsulm plant, unlike the donor 
      A8 model, the S8 has been available only in short-wheelbase form and is fitted 
      standard with Audi's quattro all-wheel drive system.</p>
